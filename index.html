            <h1>Dear Eliana :)</h1>
            <p>
                I assume you're sleeping right now, which is AWESOME cuz it gives me the chance to send this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ahh, it's been what... a year now, huh?
Oh how time is just passing by fast.
I remember the day we met in ddod, the server was dead LMAO
We didn't really talk much but I do remember you dm'ing me saying "here's what you don't have" or something along those lines and showing your cat. (which I hope she's doing alright, she shall be missed).
            </p>
            <p>
                And there we were actually genuinely talking for the first time.
I liked talking to you!
You seemed like a fun "guy" to talk to (I said guy CUZ I FUCKING THOUGHT YOU WERE A BOY DON'T ATTACK ME PLSSSSS üò≠)

            <p>
                Onnnn September, I've asked if u wanted to be friends with me and I'm happy you said yes.
And that's where our friendship and bond truly began.
And that's where your freaky ass side started to show up üò≠üò≠üôè
ITS FUNNY BUT LIKE GOD DAMN I NEVER FUCKING EXPECTED THAT FROM YOU üíÄ
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving on, fast forward ignoring all the shit I had in the past (I do not wanna talk about it or remember anything from it frfr)
We genuinely were talking every single day, every passing hour, every ticking second, non stop.
And I loved every bit of it UwU.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just having this friendship with you and talking to you even though we're far apart, has made me feel happy.
Our bond really grew alot, heh it's like our social links have maxed out ü§© (yeah persona reference (you love Ren and Ann))
            </p>
            <p>
                Omg the first time we sent voice messages was so fun HAHA üò≠
I loved it, and I'm glad we both got comfortable with talking to each other over vms and VC UwU
            </p>
            <p>
                I loved streaming stuff to you, it was so fun and funny especially the time where I streamed rh ds on my pc and you making all the stupid comments in the server üò≠
I loved it
            </p>
            <p>
                And omg our deep convos that we had in the past, I wonder why we stopped having them but I actually kinda enjoyed them alot (let's have more of them pls üôè)
            </p>
            <p>
                omggg us sending reels to each other is insanely funny.
THE AMOUNT OF REELS IS INSANE BRO LIKE JESUS üò≠
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h1>Ok, Now for the serious stuff.</h1>
            <p>
                Time really flew by, now we're in our 1st year of being best friends.
And I just wanna say...
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for this wonderful year.
I am genuinely so thankful for having you in my life Eli.
I truly truly appreciate all the help you've given me, and I hope you appreciate the help I've tried to give you whenever you needed it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You've been such a bright light to me, you've been there for me when I wasn't feeling like it was a good day, u were always there for me which makes me appreciate you a lot.
You listened and helped me a lot and I really wanna try to return the favor by helping and listening whenever I could and whenever you need me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every moment we shared was interesting yet fun and incredible.
I cherish our little goofy moments that we have, the way we just somehow say the same thing as if our minds were connected at that split second, and how we find comfort in each other's company.
            </p>
            <p>
                You showed me what real and true friendship really looks like and I just can't thank you enough for being the amazing and loving and caring person you are.
You've always offered me a big amount of love and support, whether it was celebrating the good fun times or helping me navigate through the tough hard times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eli, I really can't imagine my life without you.
You inspire me everyday to keep pushing through and to be a better person.
You're the light that shines the dark path that I have.
            </p>
            <p>
                And Eli, I'm truly happy we've made it this far and that we haven't ended anything.
it would have been really sad if we were to end things and throw away the bond we had, I really don't wanna lose this.
yeah we had those moments where it almost ended, i think you know which one im talking about.
but were still here, and i hope nothing happens and we still continue to be friends forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                We shared many fun moments didn't we?
All those days and months of talking has been truly fun.
all our deep convos to our fun goofy acts, those really were fun.
I hope this fun continues as stuff like this strengthens our bond even further.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am looking forward to how our friendship will be like in the coming years.
and I am looking forward to meeting you irl someday in the future.
i really do, there are so many things i wanna do with you.
i want to share my experiences with you and take you along my journey and i hope youll let me come along yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                and Eli, one more thing...
            </p>
            <h1>I'm truly proud of you ‚ù§Ô∏è </h1>
            <p>I'm proud of how far you've come.
                I'm proud of you for pushing through.
                I'm proud of ur achievements.

            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, I think about how different life was before we met. There were days when things felt uncertain and lonely, and I wondered if I would ever find a friend who truly understood me. 
Then you came along, and everything changed. You brought joy and warmth into my life, and for that, I am eternally grateful. It's almost bittersweet to think of how far we've come, knowing that life can change so quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                ahh here comes a sad part, if we ever split up at some point in time, i want you to know that ill remember you and everything we did and that our friendship isnt over, nothing is over in our bond, i promise you we will reconnect at some point, and i hope you wont forget me bud.
            </p>
            <p>
                ahh i just love you too much to lose you, i really do love you.
i hope you remember that.
            </p>
            <h1>To end things:</h1>
            <p>
                I want you to know how much you mean to me. You‚Äôre not just a friend, you‚Äôre like family to me.
            </p>

                you mean the world to me, i absolutely adore you.
you‚Äôre really something special to me and i wanna hold on to you for as long as possible, hoping and praying that our little bond that we have stays strong.
